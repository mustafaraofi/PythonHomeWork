class Hotel:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.rooms = []

    def book_room(self, room):
        if not room.is_occupied:
            room.is_occupied = True

    def checkout_room(self, room):
        if room.is_occupied:
            room.is_occupied = False
